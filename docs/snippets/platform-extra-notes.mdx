## CORS Configuration

For security reasons, you should configure proper CORS settings in production. In the example above, we used `cors: { origin: "*" }` which allows requests from any domain.

For production deployments, specify the exact domains that should be allowed to connect to your actors. Learn more in the [CORS documentation](/concepts/cors).

## Integration with Existing Projects

If you already have an existing application and want to mount RivetKit on a subpath, see our [Hono integration guide](/integrations/hono). Remember to specify the same path in `config.basePath` as where you mount the router.
