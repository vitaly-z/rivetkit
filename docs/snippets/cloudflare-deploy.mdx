1. Create a new KV namespace with:

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv namespace create ACTOR_KV
	```

2. After creating the KV namespace, you will receive an ID. Update your `wrangler.json` file by replacing the placeholder in the `kv_namespaces` section with this ID. It should look like this:

	```json
	{
		"kv_namespaces": [
			{
				"binding": "ACTOR_KV",
				"id": "your-namespace-id-here"  // Replace with your actual ID
			}
		]
		// ...etc...
	}
	```

3. Deploy your project to Cloudflare Workers by running:

	```sh
	npx wrangler deploy
	```

4. Update `tests/client.ts` (or wherever your client lives) to use the deployed endpoint. Replace the local endpoint in `client.ts` with your Cloudflare Workers URL:

	```typescript
	import { createClient } from "@rivetkit/actor/client";
	import type { App } from "../src/index";

	const client = createClient<App>("https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev");
	```

	Ensure you replace `your-worker-subdomain` with the actual subdomain assigned to your worker.
