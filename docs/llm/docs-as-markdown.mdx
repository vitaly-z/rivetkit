ActorCore documentation is designed to be easily accessible for Large Language Models (LLMs). All documentation pages are automatically available as plain Markdown files by simply appending `.md` to the URL.

## How to Access

To access any ActorCore documentation page as Markdown:

1. Navigate to the regular documentation URL (e.g., `https://actorcore.org/concepts/state`)
2. Append `.md` to the URL (e.g., `https://actorcore.org/concepts/state.md`)

This will return the raw Markdown content of the documentation page.

## Use Cases

This feature enables seamless integration with AI tools by providing documentation in clean Markdown format. Key uses include:

- **Context for LLM chats**: Importing relevant docs into LLM chat sessions for specific context
- **Web crawling**: Enabling efficient crawling of documentation content
- **AI agents**: Building AI agents with access to ActorCore documentation
