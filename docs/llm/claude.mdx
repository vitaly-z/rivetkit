[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is a powerful CLI tool from Anthropic that integrates Claude directly into your development workflow. When working with RivetKit, you can enhance Claude's understanding of the codebase by providing project-specific context.

## Setting Up CLAUDE.md for RivetKit

The `CLAUDE.md` file serves as a memory file for Claude Code, containing important information about your project that persists between sessions.

To set up an effective `CLAUDE.md` file for RivetKit:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the template">
    Copy the RivetKit [prompt.txt](/llm/prompt)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create file">
    Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add content">
    Paste the template into `CLAUDE.md`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify it works">
    Run Claude Code and ask a simple question like `What lifecycle hook is used when a worker is first created?` to confirm it's reading your CLAUDE.md file correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Commands for RivetKit

Here are some useful ways to leverage Claude Code with RivetKit:

### Understand the Codebase

```bash
# Get an overview of RivetKit's architecture
claude "explain the architecture of RivetKit and how the different topologies work"

# Understand how workers communicate
claude "explain how workers communicate with each other in the coordinate topology"

# Learn about specific concepts
claude "explain the lifecycle hooks for workers and when each one is called"
```

### Find Relevant Code

```bash
# Find implementations of specific components
claude "find the files that implement the Redis driver"

# Locate examples of specific patterns
claude "show me examples of RPC methods in the codebase"

# Understand worker state management
claude "explain how worker state is persisted between restarts"
```

### Add New Features

```bash
# Create a new worker implementation
claude "help me create a new worker for managing user sessions"

# Add authentication to a worker
claude "show me how to add authentication to my worker's _onBeforeConnect method"

# Implement error handling
claude "help me implement proper error handling for my worker's RPC methods"
```

### Debug Issues

```bash
# Diagnose connection problems
claude "my worker connections are dropping, help me debug why"

# Fix state persistence issues
claude "my worker state isn't persisting between restarts, what could be wrong?"

# Address scaling problems
claude "my workers are using too much memory, how can I optimize them?"
```
