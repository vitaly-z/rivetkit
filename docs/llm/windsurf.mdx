This guide shows how to integrate ActorCore with Windsurf to enhance your developer experience through AI-assisted coding.

## Setting Up Windsurf Rules for ActorCore

Windsurf rules allow you to customize how the AI assistant (Cascade) behaves when working with ActorCore code. By providing project-specific context, you'll get more accurate and relevant suggestions.

### Workspace Rules (Recommended)

Workspace rules are stored in the `.windsurfrules` file in your project root and apply to your local workspace.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open project">Open your ActorCore project in Windsurf</Step>
<Step title="Create rules file">
  Navigate to "Windsurf - Settings" (at the bottom right) > "Settings" > "Cascade" > "Set Workspace AI Rules" and click "Edit Rules."

  This will create a `.windsurfrules` file in your project root.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure rules">
  Paste [prompt.txt](/docs/llm/prompt) into the `.windsurfrules` file.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Global Rules

If you frequently work with ActorCore across multiple projects, you can add ActorCore-specific rules globally:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open settings">
  Navigate to "Windsurf - Settings" (at the bottom right) > "Settings" > "Cascade" > "Set Global AI Rules" and click "Edit Rules."
</Step>
<Step title="Add content">
  Paste [prompt.txt](/docs/llm/prompt) into the `global_rules.md` file.
</Step>
</Steps>

Global rules will apply to all of your projects when using Windsurf.
