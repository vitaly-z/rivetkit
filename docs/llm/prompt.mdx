## Using `prompt.txt` for ActorCore

The `prompt.txt` file provides LLMs with comprehensive information about ActorCore's conventions, terminology, and best practices. To use it:

1. Copy the contents below to your clipboard
2. Paste it into your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor rules, Windsurf Rules, etc.)
3. Ask your ActorCore development questions after the prompt

This structured information helps AI tools provide more accurate and contextually relevant guidance for your ActorCore development tasks.

# ActorCore Development Guide

This guide contains essential information for working with the ActorCore project.

## Project Naming and Terminology

- Use `ActorCore` when referring to the project in documentation and plain English
- Use `actor-core` (kebab-case) when referring to the project in code, package names, and imports

### Core Concepts

- **Actor**: A stateful, long-lived entity that processes messages and maintains state
- **Manager**: Component responsible for creating, routing, and managing actor instances
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: Method for an actor to expose callable functions to clients
- **Event**: Asynchronous message sent from an actor to connected clients
- **Alarm**: Scheduled callback that triggers at a specific time

## Build Commands

- **Type Check:** `yarn check-types` - Verify TypeScript types
- **Check specific package:** `yarn check-types -F actor-core` - Check only specified package
- **Build:** `yarn build` - Production build using Turbopack
- **Build specific package:** `yarn build -F actor-core` - Build only specified package
- **Format:** `yarn fmt` - Format code with Biome

## Driver Implementations

Available driver implementations:

- **Memory**: In-memory implementation for development and testing
- **Redis**: Production-ready implementation using Redis for persistence and pub/sub
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Uses Durable Objects for actor state persistence
- **Rivet**: Fully-managed cloud platform with built-in scaling and monitoring

## Platform Support

ActorCore supports multiple runtime environments:

- **NodeJS**: Standard Node.js server environment
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Edge computing environment
- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript runtime alternative to Node.js
- **Rivet**: Cloud platform with built-in scaling and management

## Package Import Resolution

When importing from workspace packages, always check the package's `package.json` file under the `exports` field to determine the correct import paths:

1. Locate the package's `package.json` file
2. Find the `exports` object which maps subpath patterns to their file locations
3. Use these defined subpaths in your imports rather than direct file paths

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Formatting:** Uses Biome for consistent formatting
- **Imports:** Organized imports enforced, unused imports warned
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled, target ESNext
- **Naming:** 
  - camelCase for variables, functions
  - PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
  - Use `#` prefix for private class members (not `private` keyword)
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Extend from `ActorError` base class
  - Use `UserError` for client-safe errors
  - Use `InternalError` for internal errors

## Project Structure

- Monorepo with Yarn workspaces and Turborepo
- Core code in `packages/actor-core/`
- Platform implementations in `packages/platforms/`
- Driver implementations in `packages/drivers/`

## State Management

- Each actor owns and manages its own isolated state via `this._state`
- State is automatically persisted between RPC calls
- State is initialized once via `_onInitialize` method
- Only JSON-serializable types can be stored in state
- Use `this._onStateChange` to react to state changes

## Authentication and Security

- Authentication is handled through the `_onBeforeConnect` lifecycle method
- Connection state is accessed with `rpc.connection.state`
- Access control should be implemented for each RPC method
- Throwing an error in `_onBeforeConnect` will abort the connection
- Use `UserError` for safe error messages to clients
- Use data validation libraries like zod for input validation

## RPC and Events

- **RPC**: Used for clients to call actor methods
- **Events**: For actors to publish updates to clients
- Methods starting with `_` or `#` are private and not callable by clients
- Broadcasting is done via `this._broadcast(name, data)`
- Specific client messaging uses `connection.send(name, data)`
- Clients subscribe to events with `actor.on(eventName, callback)`

## Lifecycle Hooks

- `_onInitialize()`: Called once when actor is first created
- `_onStart()`: Called any time actor is started (after restart/upgrade)
- `_onStateChange(newState)`: Called when actor state changes
- `_onBeforeConnect(opts)`: Called when new client connects
- `_onConnect(connection)`: Executed after client connection succeeds
- `_onDisconnect(connection)`: Called when client disconnects

## Actor Management

- Actors are referenced using tags (key-value pairs)
- The `name` tag is required and specifies the actor type
- Actors can be created with `client.get(tags, opts)`
- Actors can be shut down with `this._shutdown()` from within the actor
- Metadata like region and tags are available via `this._region` and `this._tags`

## Scaling and Architecture Guidelines

- Each actor should have a single responsibility
- Keep state minimal and relevant to the actor's core function
- Use separate actors for different entity types (users, rooms, documents)
- Avoid too many cross-actor communications
- Use appropriate topology based on your scaling needs

## Scheduling

- Schedule future events with `after(duration, fn, ...args)`
- Schedule events for specific time with `at(timestamp, fn, ...args)`
- Scheduled events persist across actor restarts

## CORS Configuration

- Configure CORS to allow cross-origin requests in production
- Set allowed origins, methods, headers, and credentials
- For development, use `cors: { origin: "http://localhost:3000" }`

## Development Best Practices

- Prefer classes over factory functions
- Use zod for runtime type validation
- Use `assertUnreachable(x: never)` for exhaustive type checking
- Add proper JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Run `yarn check-types` regularly during development
- Use `tsx` CLI to execute TypeScript scripts directly
