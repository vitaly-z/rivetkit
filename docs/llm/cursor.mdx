This guide shows how to integrate ActorCore with Cursor to enhance your developer experience through AI-assisted coding.

## Setting Up Cursor Rules for ActorCore

Cursor rules allow you to customize how the AI assistant behaves when working with ActorCore code. By providing project-specific context, you'll get more accurate and relevant suggestions.

### Project Rules (Recommended)

Project rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory and apply to specific files or folders in your project.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open project">Open your ActorCore project in Cursor</Step>
<Step title="Create rule">
  Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux).

  Select `New Cursor Rule` and name it `actorcore-development-guide`.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure rule">
  Set `Auto Attach` to `**/*.ts`.

  Paste [prompt.txt](/llm/prompt) into the rule.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Global Rules

If you frequently work with ActorCore across multiple projects, you can add ActorCore-specific rules globally:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open settings">
  Open Cursor and go to `Cursor Settings` > `Rules` > `User Rules`
</Step>
<Step title="Add content">
  Paste [prompt.txt](/llm/prompt) into the textbox
</Step>
</Steps>

Global rules will apply to all of your projects when using Cursor.
