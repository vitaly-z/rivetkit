## Create New Project

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create Project with CLI">
		Run this command:

		<CreateActorCli />

		Follow the prompts:
		1. **Where would you like to create your project?** - Choose your project directory
		2. **To which platform would you like to deploy?** - Select Node.js
		3. **Which template would you like to use?** - Select counter, or your template of choice

		The CLI will set up your project and install all dependencies automatically.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Start Development Server">
		Start your development server with:

		```sh
		cd your-project
		npm run dev
		```

		This will start your ActorCore server in development mode.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Test">
		In a separate terminal, run the auto-generated test client:

		```sh
		npx tsx tests/client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 5
		# RPC: 5
		```

		Run this again to see the state update.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Deploy">
		_Request a guide for deploying Node.js to your preferred cloud provider on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rivet-gg/actor-core/discussions)._
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Integrate With Existing Projects

If you already have a Node.js project and want to add ActorCore, you can follow these steps for manual integration. This approach gives you more control over how ActorCore fits into your existing codebase.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Install Packages">
		<CodeGroup>
			```sh npm
			# Install ActorCore
			npm add actor-core @actor-core/nodejs
			```

			```sh pnpm
			# Install ActorCore
			pnpm add actor-core @actor-core/nodejs
			```

			```sh yarn
			# Install ActorCore
			yarn add actor-core @actor-core/nodejs
			```

			```sh bun
			# Install ActorCore
			bun add actor-core @actor-core/nodejs
			```
		</CodeGroup>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create Actor">
		Create a new file for your actor at `src/app.ts`:

		<SetupActor />
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create Entrypoint">
		Create `src/index.ts` to start your ActorCore server with:

		```typescript src/index.ts
		import { setup, serve } from "@actor-core/nodejs";
		import { app } from "./app";

		serve(app);
		```

		<IntegrationExistingProjects />
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create Client">
		Create a client to connect to your actor in `src/client.ts`:

		```typescript src/client.ts
		import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
		import type { App } from "./app";

		async function main() {
			const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");

			const counter = await client.counter.get();

			counter.on("newCount", (count: number) => console.log("Event:", count));

			const out = await counter.increment(5);
			console.log("Action:", out);

			await counter.dispose();
		}

		main();
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Test">
		Start your development server with:

		```sh
		npx tsx src/index.ts
		```

		Then run the client in another terminal with:

		```sh
		npx tsx src/client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 5
		# Action: 5
		```

		Run this again to see the state update.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Available Regions

Node.js can only run in one region at the moment. See [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) and [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) for supporting multiple regions.
