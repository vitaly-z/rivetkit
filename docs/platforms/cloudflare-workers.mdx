import SetupActor from '/snippets/setup-actor.mdx';

<Note>
	ActorCore relies on features only available in the Workers Paid plan ([more info](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/)).

	To deploy hobby projects with ActorCore for free, try deploying to [Rivet](/platforms/rivet).
</Note>

<Info>
	ActorCore is still pre-v1.0. Please help us by report bugs on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rivet-gg/actor-core/issues)!

    		cd my-project

    		# Install ActorCore
    		bun add actor-core @actor-core/cloudflare-workers
    		```

    	<Tip>ActorCore can also be used with existing Cloudflare projects.</Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Actor">
    	Create a new file for your actor at `src/counter.ts`:

		<SetupActor />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Cloudflare">
    	Update both `src/index.ts` and `wrangler.json` to look like this:

		<CodeGroup>

    	```typescript src/index.ts
    	import { createHandler } from "@actor-core/cloudflare-workers";
    	import Counter from "./counter.ts";

    	const { handler, ActorHandler } = createHandler({
    		actors: {
    			"counter": Counter
    		}
    	});

    	export { handler as default, ActorHandler };
    	```

    	```json wrangler.json
    	{
    		"name": "my-project",
    		"main": "src/index.ts",
    		"compatibility_date": "2025-01-29",
    		"migrations": [
    			{
    				"new_classes": ["ActorHandler"],
    				"tag": "v1"
    			}
    		],
    		"durable_objects": {
    			"bindings": [
    			{
    				"class_name": "ActorHandler",
    				"name": "ACTOR_DO"
    			}
    			]
    		},
    		"kv_namespaces": [
    			{
    				"binding": "ACTOR_KV",
    				"id": "FILL_ME_IN_WHEN_YOU_DEPLOY"
    			}
    		]
    	}
    	```

		</CodeGroup>

		In `src/index.ts`, `handler` is used to handle HTTP requests made to the worker. `ActorHandler` is a Durable Object used to provide state for your actors.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Client & Test">
		To start your development server, run:

		```sh
		npx wrangler dev
		```

		Now, write a file named `client.ts` with this:

		```typescript client.ts
		import { Client } from "actor-core/client";
		import type Counter from "../src/counter.ts";

		async function main() {
			const client = new Client("http://localhost:8787");

			const counter = await client.get<Counter>({ name: "counter" });

			counter.on("newCount", (count: number) => console.log("Event:", count));

			const out = await counter.increment(5);
			console.log("RPC:", out);

			await counter.disconnect();
		}

		main();
		```

		Run the file with:

		```sh
		npx tsx client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 43
		# RPC: 43
		```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy">
		1. Create a new KV namespace with:

			```sh
			npx wrangler kv namespace create ACTOR_KV
			```
		
		2. After creating the KV namespace, you will receive an ID. Update your `wrangler.json` file by replacing the placeholder in the `kv_namespaces` section with this ID. It should look like this:

			```json
			{
				"kv_namespaces": [
					{
						"binding": "ACTOR_KV",
						"id": "your-namespace-id-here"  // Replace with your actual ID
					}
				]
				// ...etc...
			}
			```

		3. Deploy your project to Cloudflare Workers by running:

			```sh
			npx wrangler deploy
			```

		4. Update your client to use the deployed endpoint. Replace the local endpoint in `client.ts` with your Cloudflare Workers URL:

			```typescript
			const client = new Client("https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev");
			```

			Ensure you replace `your-worker-subdomain` with the actual subdomain assigned to your worker.

		5. Test your deployed application by running the client script again:

			```sh
			npx tsx client.ts
			```
