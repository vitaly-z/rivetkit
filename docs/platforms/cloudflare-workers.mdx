<Note>
	ActorCore relies on features only available in the Workers Paid plan ([more info](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/)).

	To deploy hobby projects with ActorCore for free, try deploying to [Rivet](https://rivet.gg/docs/setup).

## Create New Project

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create Project with CLI">
		Run this command:

		<CreateActorCli />

		Follow the prompts:
		1. **Where would you like to create your project?** - Choose your project directory
		2. **To which platform would you like to deploy?** - Select Cloudflare Workers
		3. **Which template would you like to use?** - Select counter, or your template of choice

		The CLI will set up your project and install all dependencies automatically.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Start Development Server">
		Start your development server with:

		```sh
		cd your-project
		npm run dev
		```

		This will start your ActorCore server in development mode with Wrangler.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Test">
		In a separate terminal, run the auto-generated test client:

		```sh
		npx tsx tests/client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 1
		# RPC: 1
		```

		Run this again to see the state update.

## Integrating With Existing Projects

If you already have a Cloudflare Workers project and want to add ActorCore, you can follow these steps for manual integration. This approach gives you more control over how ActorCore fits into your existing Cloudflare Workers project.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Install Packages">
		<CodeGroup>
			```sh npm
			# Install ActorCore
			npm add actor-core @actor-core/cloudflare-workers
			```

			```sh pnpm
			# Install ActorCore
			pnpm add actor-core @actor-core/cloudflare-workers
			```

			```sh yarn
			# Install ActorCore
			yarn add actor-core @actor-core/cloudflare-workers
			```

			```sh bun
			# Install ActorCore
			bun add actor-core @actor-core/cloudflare-workers
			```
		</CodeGroup>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create Actor">
		Create a new file for your actor at `src/counter.ts`:

		<SetupActor />
	</Step>
	<Step title="Configure Cloudflare">
		Update both `src/index.ts` and `wrangler.json` to look like this:

		<CodeGroup>

		```typescript src/index.ts
		import { createHandler } from "@actor-core/cloudflare-workers";
		import Counter from "./counter";

		const { handler, ActorHandler } = createHandler({
			actors: {
				"counter": Counter
			},
			// Change this to match your frontend's origin
			cors: { origin: "http://localhost:3000" }
		});

		export { handler as default, ActorHandler };
		```

		```json wrangler.json
		{
			"name": "my-project",
			"main": "src/index.ts",
			"compatibility_date": "2025-01-29",
			"migrations": [
				{
					"new_classes": ["ActorHandler"],
					"tag": "v1"
				}
			],
			"durable_objects": {
				"bindings": [
				{
					"class_name": "ActorHandler",
					"name": "ACTOR_DO"
				}
				]
			},
			"kv_namespaces": [
				{
					"binding": "ACTOR_KV",
					"id": "FILL_ME_IN_WHEN_YOU_DEPLOY"
				}
			]
		}
		```

		</CodeGroup>

		In `src/index.ts`, `handler` is used to handle HTTP requests made to the worker. `ActorHandler` is a Durable Object used to provide state for your actors.

		<IntegrationExistingProjects />
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create Client & Test">
		To start your development server, run:

		```sh
		npx wrangler dev
		```

		Now, write a file named `client.ts` with this:

		```typescript client.ts
		import { Client } from "actor-core/client";
		import type Counter from "./src/counter.ts";

		async function main() {
			const client = new Client("http://localhost:8787");

			const counter = await client.get<Counter>({ name: "counter" });

			counter.on("newCount", (count: number) => console.log("Event:", count));

			const out = await counter.increment(5);
			console.log("RPC:", out);

			await counter.disconnect();
		}

		main();
		```

		Run the file in a second terminal with:

		```sh
		npx tsx client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 1
		# RPC: 1
		```
		
		Run this again to see the state update.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Deploy">
		<CloudflareDeploy />
	</Step>
</Steps>
