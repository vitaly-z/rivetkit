<Update label="0.7.4" description="March 18th, 2025">
  ## Features

  - [**Rust Client**](/clients/rust): You can now connect to ActorCore actors with Rust.

  ## Documentation
  
  - Documentation on how to use all available clients
  - Update [Interacting with Actors](/concepts/interacting-with-actors) to include Rust code examples
</Update>

<Update label="0.7.2" description="March 18th, 2025">
  ## Features

  - **Add ephemeral `c.vars`** Create variables that are not stored in storage with `actor({ vars })` and `actor({ createVars })`
  - **Extract context types** Add `ActorContextOf<ActorDefinition>` and `ActionContextOf<ActorDefinition>` to make it easy to pass around context types
</Update>

<Update label="0.7.1" description="March 17th, 2025">
  ## Enhancements

  **actor-core**

  - Pass `ActorContext` to all `on*` events
  - Expose `name` in `ActorContext`

  **@actor-core/nodejs**

  - Return `ServerType` from `serve`

  ## Fixes

  - Make `UserError.metadata` optional
  - Remove reliance on Zod generic interfaces for actor configs due to TSC bugs
</Update>

<Update label="0.7.0" description="March 16th, 2025">
  ## Features

  - **Functional Actor API**: Instead of subclassing with `extends Actor`, actors are now created by using `actor({ ... })`
  - **Cleaner & More Type-Safe Client**: Instead of manually specifying actor names with `client.get<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat-room" })`, you can now simply call `client.chatRoom.get()`
  - **Shorthand State Initiation**: Use  `state` and `connState` to create state without having to implement `createState` and `createConnState`
  - **Portable ActorCore App**: Use `setup` to create an ActorCore app that can be connected to multiple platforms without extra modification.

  ## Enhancements

  - Rename "RPC" to "Actions"
  - Add `createState` instead of using return value from `onInitialize` for clarity
  - Add `createConnState` instead of using return value from `onBeforeConnect` for clarity
  - Rename `onInitialize` to `onCreate`
</Update>

<Update label="0.6.3" description="March 13th, 2025">
  ## Features

  - **`client.dispose()`**: Dipsose of the client to disconnect from all actors

  ## Enhancements

  - **Cleaner error responses**: All error responses from both the manager & actors now provide a standard format & logs

  ## Fixes

  - WebSockets not working with CORS
  - `WebSocket` & `EventEmitter` not working with some bundlers
  - Explicitly use `ws:` and `wss:` protocol for WebSockets for greater compatibility
</Update>

<Update label="0.6.2" description="March 12th, 2025">
  ## Features

  - **`create-actor --skip-dependencies`**: Skip installing NPM dependencies after creation
