## Lifecycle Hooks

Actor lifecycle hooks are defined as functions in the actor configuration.

### `createState` and `state`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onInitialize) */}

The `createState` function or `state` constant defines the initial state of the actor (see [state documentation](/concepts/state)). The `createState` function is called only once when the actor is first created.

### `onCreate`

The `onCreate` hook is called at the same time as `createState`, but unlike `createState`, it doesn't return any value. Use this hook for initialization logic that doesn't affect the initial state.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

// Using state constant
const counter1 = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});

// Using createState function
const counter2 = actor({
  createState: () => {
    // Initialize with a count of 0
    return { count: 0 };
  },
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});

// Using onCreate
const counter3 = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  // Run initialization logic (logging, external service setup, etc.)
  onCreate: (c) => {
    console.log("Counter actor initialized");
    // Can perform async operations or setup
    // No need to return anything
  },
  
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});
```

### `onStart`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onStart) */}

This hook is called any time the actor is started (e.g. after restarting, upgrading code, or crashing).

This is called after the actor has been initialized but before any connections are accepted.

Use this hook to set up any resources or start any background tasks, such as `setInterval`.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  onStart: (c) => {
    console.log('Actor started with count:', c.state.count);
    
    // Set up interval for automatic counting
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      c.state.count++;
      console.log('Auto-increment:', c.state.count);
    }, 10000);
    
    // Store interval ID to clean up later if needed
    c.custom.intervalId = intervalId;
  },
  
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});
```

### `onStateChange`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onStateChange) */}

Called whenever the actor's state changes. This is often used to broadcast state updates.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  onStateChange: (c, newState) => {
    // Broadcast the new count to all connected clients
    c.broadcast('countUpdated', {
      count: newState.count
    });
  },
  
  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      c.state.count++;
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});
```

### `createConnState` and `connState`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._createConnState) */}

There are two ways to define the initial state for connections:
1. `connState`: Define a constant object that will be used as the initial state for all connections
2. `createConnState`: A function that dynamically creates initial connection state based on connection parameters

### `onBeforeConnect`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onBeforeConnect) */}

The `onBeforeConnect` hook is called whenever a new client connects to the actor. Clients can pass parameters when connecting, accessible via `params`. This hook is used for connection validation and can throw errors to reject connections.

The `onBeforeConnect` hook does NOT return connection state - it's used solely for validation.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { messages: [] },
  
  // Method 1: Use a static default connection state
  connState: {
    role: "guest",
    joinTime: 0,
  },
  
  // Method 2: Dynamically create connection state
  createConnState: (c, { params }) => {
    return {
      userId: params.userId || "anonymous",
      role: params.role || "guest",
      joinTime: Date.now()
    };
  },
  
  // Validate connections before accepting them
  onBeforeConnect: (c, { params }) => {
    // Validate authentication
    const authToken = params.authToken;
    if (!authToken || !validateToken(authToken)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid authentication");
    }
    
    // Authentication is valid, connection will proceed
    // The actual connection state will come from connState or createConnState
  },
  
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});
```

Connections cannot interact with the actor until this method completes successfully. Throwing an error will abort the connection. This can be used for authentication - see [Authentication](/concepts/authentication) for details.

### `onConnect`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onConnect) */}

Executed after the client has successfully connected.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { users: {}, messages: [] },
  
  onConnect: (c) => {
    // Add user to the room's user list using connection state
    const userId = c.conn.state.userId;
    c.state.users[userId] = {
      online: true,
      lastSeen: Date.now()
    };
    
    // Broadcast that a user joined
    c.broadcast("userJoined", { userId, timestamp: Date.now() });
    
    console.log(`User ${userId} connected`);
  },
  
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});
```

Messages will not be processed for this actor until this hook succeeds. Errors thrown from this hook will cause the client to disconnect.

### `onDisconnect`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor/doc/~/Actor.prototype._onDisconnect) */}

Called when a client disconnects from the actor. Use this to clean up any connection-specific resources.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { users: {}, messages: [] },
  
  onDisconnect: (c) => {
    // Update user status when they disconnect
    const userId = c.conn.state.userId;
    if (c.state.users[userId]) {
      c.state.users[userId].online = false;
      c.state.users[userId].lastSeen = Date.now();
    }
    
    // Broadcast that a user left
    c.broadcast("userLeft", { userId, timestamp: Date.now() });
    
    console.log(`User ${userId} disconnected`);
  },
  
  actions: { /* ... */ }
});
```

## Destroying Actors

Actors can be shut down gracefully with `c.shutdown()`. Clients will be gracefully disconnected.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const temporaryRoom = actor({
  state: { 
    createdAt: 0,
    expiresAfterMs: 3600000 // 1 hour
  },
  
  createState: () => ({
    createdAt: Date.now(),
    expiresAfterMs: 3600000 // 1 hour
  }),
  
  onStart: (c) => {
    // Check if room is expired
    const now = Date.now();
    const expiresAt = c.state.createdAt + c.state.expiresAfterMs;
    
    if (now > expiresAt) {
      console.log("Room expired, shutting down");
      c.shutdown();
    } else {
      // Set up expiration timer
      const timeUntilExpiry = expiresAt - now;
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Room lifetime reached, shutting down");
        c.shutdown();
      }, timeUntilExpiry);
    }
  },
  
  actions: {
    closeRoom: (c) => {
      // Notify all clients
      c.broadcast("roomClosed", { reason: "Admin closed the room" });
      
      // Shutdown the actor
      c.shutdown();
    }
  }
});
```

This action is permanent and cannot be reverted.

## Using `ActorContext` Type Externally

When extracting logic from lifecycle hooks or actions into external functions, you'll often need to define the type of the context parameter. ActorCore provides helper types that make it easy to extract and pass these context types to external functions.

```typescript
import { actor, ActorContextOf } from "actor-core";

const myActor = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  // Use external function in lifecycle hook
  onStart: (c) => logActorStarted(c)
});

// Simple external function with typed context
function logActorStarted(c: ActorContextOf<typeof myActor>) {
  console.log(`Actor started with count: ${c.state.count}`);
}
```

See [Helper Types](/concepts/types) for more details on using `ActorContextOf`.

## Full Example

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const counter = actor({
  // Initialize state
  createState: () => ({
    count: 0
  }),
  
  // Initialize actor (run setup that doesn't affect initial state)
  onCreate: (c) => {
    console.log('Counter actor initialized');
    // Set up external resources, etc.
  },
  
  // Define default connection state
  connState: {
    role: "guest"
  },
  
  // Dynamically create connection state based on params
  createConnState: (c, { params }) => {
    // Get auth info from validation
    const authToken = params.authToken;
    const authInfo = validateAuthToken(authToken);
    
    return {
      userId: authInfo?.userId || "anonymous",
      role: authInfo?.role || "guest"
    };
  },
  
  // Lifecycle hooks
  onStart: (c) => {
    console.log('Counter started with count:', c.state.count);
  },
  
  onStateChange: (c, newState) => {
    c.broadcast('countUpdated', { count: newState.count });
  },
  
  onBeforeConnect: (c, { params }) => {
    // Validate auth token
    const authToken = params.authToken;
    if (!authToken) {
      throw new Error('Missing auth token');
    }
    
    // Validate with your API and determine the user
    const authInfo = validateAuthToken(authToken);
    if (!authInfo) {
      throw new Error('Invalid auth token');
    }
    
    // If validation succeeds, connection proceeds
    // Connection state will be set by createConnState
  },
  
  onConnect: (c) => {
    console.log(`User ${c.conn.state.userId} connected`);
  },
  
  onDisconnect: (c) => {
    console.log(`User ${c.conn.state.userId} disconnected`);
  },
  
  // Define actions
  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      c.state.count++;
      return c.state.count;
    },
    
    reset: (c) => {
      // Check if user has admin role
      if (c.conns.state.role !== "admin") {
        throw new Error("Unauthorized: requires admin role");
      }
      
      c.state.count = 0;
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});

export default counter;
```
