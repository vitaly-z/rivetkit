Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows a web application running at one origin to access resources from a different origin. Without CORS, browsers block cross-origin HTTP requests by default as a security measure.

You'll need to configure CORS when:

- **Local Development**: You're developing locally and your client runs on a different port than your actor service
- **Different Domain**: Your frontend application is hosted on a different domain than your actor service

## Example

```ts
import { setup } from "rivetkit";
import counter from "./counter";

const registry = setup({
  use: { counter },
  // Change this to match your frontend's origin
  cors: { origin: "https://yourdomain.com" }
});
```

## Options

### `origin`

`string | string[] | (origin:string, c:Context) => string` (optional)

Specifies which domains can access your resources. Options:
- Single domain: `"https://example.com"`
- Multiple domains: `["https://app.com", "https://admin.com"]`
- Dynamic validation: `(origin) => origin.endsWith('.example.com') ? origin : null`
- All domains (not recommended for production): `"*"` (default)

### `allowMethods`

`string[]` (optional)

HTTP methods clients are allowed to use when accessing your resources. Default includes all standard methods: `['GET', 'HEAD', 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE', 'PATCH']`.

### `allowHeaders`

`string[]` (optional)

Custom HTTP headers clients can send in requests. Empty by default `[]`. Common examples:
- `["Content-Type", "Authorization", "X-API-Key"]`

### `maxAge`

`number` (optional)

How long browsers should cache CORS response (in seconds). Higher values improve performance by reducing preflight requests.

### `credentials`

`boolean` (optional)

Whether requests can include user credentials like cookies or HTTP authentication. Must specify exact origins when enabled (cannot use with `origin: "*"`).

### `exposeHeaders`

`string[]` (optional)

Server headers that browsers are allowed to access. Empty by default `[]`. Example:
- `["Content-Length", "X-Request-Id"]`
