The RivetKit Python client provides a way to connect to and interact with workers from Python applications.

<MvpWarning />

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Python project">
    Create a new directory for your project:
    
    ```sh
    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    ```

    It's recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add dependencies">
    Install the RivetKit client package:
    
    ```sh
    pip install rivetkit-client
    ```
  </Step>

  <StepDefineWorker />

  <Step title="Create your client">
    Create a new file `main.py`:

    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Async
        import asyncio
        from worker_core_client import AsyncClient

        async def main():
            # Replace with your endpoint URL after deployment
            client = AsyncClient("http://localhost:6420")
            
            # Get or create a worker instance
            counter = await client.get("counter")
            
            # Subscribe to events using callback
            def on_new_count(msg):
                print(f"Event: {msg}")
                
            counter.on_event("newCount", on_new_count)
            
            # Call an action
            result = await counter.action("increment", 5)
            print(f"Action result: {result}")
            
            # Wait to receive events
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            
            # Clean up
            await counter.disconnect()

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            asyncio.run(main())
        ```

        ```python Sync
        from worker_core_client import Client

        # Replace with your endpoint URL after deployment
        client = Client("http://localhost:6420")
        
        # Get or create a worker instance
        counter = client.get("counter")
        
        # Subscribe to events using callback
        def on_new_count(msg):
            print(f"Event: {msg}")
            
            # Clean up once we receive our event
            counter.disconnect()
        
        counter.on_event("newCount", on_new_count)
        
        # Call an action
        result = counter.action("increment", 5)
        print(f"Action result: {result}")

        # Clean is handled on by on_new_count
        ```
    </CodeGroup>

    In the code above, subscription is done with `on_event` callbacks, but you can also
    subscribe directly with `receive()` calls, using the `SimpleClient` (and `AsyncSimpleClient`)
    interfaces. See our [sample usage](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivetkit/tree/main/clients/python/tests/test_e2e_simple_async.py) for more details.
  </Step>

  <StepRunStudio />

  <Step title="Run your client">
    In a separate terminal, run your Python code:
    
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
    
    You should see output like:
    ```
    Event: 5
    Action result: 5
    ```

    Run it again to see the state update.
