import DriverNote from '/snippets/driver-note.mdx';

The Memory Driver is a simple in-memory implementation designed for development and testing environments. It stores all actor state in memory, which means data is not persisted between application restarts.

<DriverNote />

<Warning>
  The Memory Driver is not recommended for production environments as it doesn't provide persistence or distributed capabilities.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install the required packages:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install @actor-core/memory @actor-core/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add @actor-core/memory @actor-core/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm add @actor-core/memory @actor-core/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bun add @actor-core/memory @actor-core/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a simple server using the Memory driver:

    ```typescript src/index.ts
    import { serve } from "@actor-core/nodejs"
    import { MemoryManagerDriver } from "@actor-core/memory/manager";
    import { MemoryActorDriver } from "@actor-core/memory/actor";
    import Counter from "./counter";

    serve({
      actors: { "counter": Counter },
      topology: "standalone",
      drivers: {
        manager: new MemoryManagerDriver(),
        actor: new MemoryActorDriver(),
      },
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Start your server:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bun dev
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations

The Memory driver has several limitations to be aware of:

- **No Persistence**: All data is stored in memory and lost when the application restarts
- **Single Process**: Only works within a single process - not suitable for distributed environments 
- **Scalability**: Cannot scale beyond a single instance
- **Coordination**: Limited support for coordinated topology, as actors can only communicate within the same process

<Tip>
  For production environments or applications requiring persistence and distributed capabilities, consider using the [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) or [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) instead.
