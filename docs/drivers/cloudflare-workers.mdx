import DriverNote from '/snippets/driver-note.mdx';

The Cloudflare Workers Driver is an implementation that uses Cloudflare's Durable Objects for actor state persistence and coordination. It leverages Cloudflare's global network for low-latency, distributed actor systems that can scale automatically.

## Usage

There's no need to explicitly configure drivers when using ActorCore with Cloudflare Workers. The platform package automatically sets up the appropriate drivers.

See the [Cloudflare Workers Platform](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) documentation for complete setup instructions.

## Limitations

The Cloudflare Workers driver has several limitations to be aware of:

- **Storage Limits**: Storage is limited to Cloudflare's Durable Objects size limits
- **Cost**: Requires Cloudflare Workers Paid plan for Durable Objects usage
- **Platform Lock-in**: Your implementation will be specific to the Cloudflare Workers platform

<Tip>
  For a platform-agnostic approach with similar global distribution capabilities, consider using [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) instead.
